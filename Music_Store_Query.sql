    WHEN Title ILIKE '%Chief%' THEN 1
    WHEN Title ILIKE '%Head%' THEN 2

-- 2) Which countries have the most Invoices?
SELECT

  COUNT(*) AS invoice_count
FROM invoices

-- 3) What are top 3 values of total invoice?
--    (Top 3 distinct invoice totals)
SELECT DISTINCT Total
FROM invoices
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 4) Which city has the best customers? (city with highest sum of invoice totals)
SELECT
  BillingCity,
  SUM(Total) AS total_revenue
FROM invoices

-- 5) Who is the best customer? (customer who has spent the most money)

-- Question Set 2 - Moderate
-- ############################

-- 1) Return email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock listeners.
--    Order by email alphabetically starting with 'A'.

-- Question Set 3 - Advance
-- ############################
